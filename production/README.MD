# Robot Calibration and Line Following

## How It Works
1. **Calibration**: The robot moves for a specified time to cover a certain distance we give it the traveled distance.
2. **Line Following**: After moving, the robot follows a line until it completes the time given which is calculated for how long the line is.

## Setup
1. Run first script input distance for both forward and line following
2. Input outputed values to main code.
